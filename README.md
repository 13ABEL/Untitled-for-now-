## Hearthstone deckbuilding app

I'm making this android project to build a better understanding of:
  1. Clean Architecture
  2. MVP design pattern

By separating the application into domain layers, the **Presentation**, **Domain**, and **Data** layers are completely decoupled. This paves the way for significantly easier testing and code modification.


Technologies used:
  1. Firebase Firestore is used as the backend database solution.


## Currently implemented: 
- displaydecks: Displays current decks from the Firebase Firestore database

## What still needs to be done:
- displaydecks: 
  - Need to implement sorting and filtering (lots to do on the Firebase Firestore side)
  - Need to design the layout for individual items and implement it

- singledeck: 
  - Need to design the layout displaying the deck and implement it
